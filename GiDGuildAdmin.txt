Feature List: 
1. Track and monitor membership. 
2. Track and monitor loot drops. 
3. Track character statistics
4. Phone and xbox integration. 	
5. Need to add auto text parsing to the form inputs (optional)
6. Ensure the member data is stored in a local file - later move to cloud storage. 
6. Need logging to monitor the local file storage of data. 
7. Later need to move the local file storage to the cloud. 

Bob's ideas: 
1. Track participation
2. Understand who has the greatest need. 
3. Website integration. 
4. Assign teams based on members availibilty and times 
5. Track pvp stats and mythic+ stats 
6. Assign team leaders (Id say keep teams seperate minimise mix team raiding) 
7: Top 10s (in guild dps, heal, tank(not sure how to rate tanking))

Newest thoughts - all these need to be in Issue tasks: 
Add Management console to hide add/remove pieces. 
Need to be able to add Guilds. 
Need to be able to add Communities. 
Need to store the Guild data separately. 
Need a function to pull the Realms/Server list.
